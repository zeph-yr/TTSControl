# TTSControl

### _"You ain't heard yet? You not get the message?"_ Now they will.

Every asked your lovely viewers to give you a moment during a high pp play but a few special ones just don't seem to get it? Worry no more, you can have silence with the click of a button!

For those using browser based TTS. Toggles the volume on Chrome On/Off with controller trigger in map and via UI button in main lobby. Designed to be easier to mute than to unmute to minimize accidently unmuting when you really need a moment to yourself.

This is an early release! Please feel free to reach out if you have feedback :)
