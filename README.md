# TTSControl

### _"You ain't heard yet? You not get the message?"_ Now they will.

Ever asked your lovely viewers to kindly give you a moment during a high pp play but a few special ones just don't seem to get it or don't want to respect you? Worry no more, you can have silence with the click of a button!

For those using browser based TTS. Toggles the volume on Chrome On/Off with controller trigger in map and via UI button in main lobby. Designed to be easier to mute than to unmute to minimize accidently unmuting when you really need a moment to yourself.

This is an early release! Please feel free to reach out if you have feedback :)

## How To Use
- Requires a freeware tool SoundVolumeView. Get it here https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/soundvolumeview.zip and put the .exe in your /Beat Saber directory
- Place TTSControl.dll in your Plugins directory
- Start your browser TTS
- In Map: Pull RIGHT trigger to mute. Pull LEFT trigger to unmute
- In Lobby: Button displays current state of TTS. Click to change it.
- Requires: BSIPA, BSML, BS_Utils, SiraUtil
- **Note for Introskip:** I understand this might have some implications with Introskip during the skip periods. If you use Introskip, note that skipping will trigger the mute/ummute. Use the Menu toggle if you want to mute before going into a map :)

## Coming Soon
- Support for browser of your choice
- Choice of left or right hand

## About
My 3rd mod :3 If you enjoy this, I appreciate your feedback :) I am new to modding, so no code for this released yet... I'm kinda shy because this is so early in development.
